Jupyter Notebook Created by Shardav Bhatt

In this notebook, I have considered data of COVID-19 cases in India to perform curve fitting on it. The graphs given data and fitted data are shown. Separate graphs of number of cases, number of deaths and number of recovered are shown for cummulative data as well as daily data. The curve fitting is in terms of polynomial fitting based on method of least square.
